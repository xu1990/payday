# Note: Client-side token encryption has been removed because:
# - Vite environment variables are exposed in client bundle
# - Client-side encryption provides no real security
# - JWT tokens are already cryptographically signed by the backend
# - Real security comes from short expiration, refresh tokens, and backend validation
